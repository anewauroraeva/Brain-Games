Welcome to the Brain Games!
Brain Games is a set of five console arithmetic games. Each game require answers that need to be written correctly: yes/no or a number. There are three rounds in each of the games that you need to complete to win a game. Wrong answers end the game, but you can replay it.

The Brain Games project consists of five games:
1. Is This Number Even? (brain-even) 
    Determine if the number is even.
2. Calculate This (brain-calc)
    Calculate an arithmetic expression.
3. Greatest Common Divisor (brain-gcd)
    Determine the greatest common divisor of the pair of numbers.
4. Progression (brain-progression)
    Enter the missing number in a sequence of numbers.
5. Is This Number Prime? (brain-prime)
    Determine if the number is prime.

System requirements:
- The games can only be run on Unix-like operating systems
- Node.js v13 or higher

Installation:
1. Clone the repository https://github.com/anewauroraeva/frontend-project-44
2. Go to repository directory cd frontend-project-44
3. Install dependencies make install
4. Install the package npm link

How to start a game:
